Definition: A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.[1] That is, it is a spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is as small as possible.

The time complexity of Prim's algorithm:
adjacency matrix, searching 	O ( | V | 2 )
binary heap and adjacency list 	O ( ( | V | + | E | ) log ⁡ | V | ) = O ( | E | log ⁡ | V | )
Fibonacci heap and adjacency list 	O ( | E | + | V | log ⁡ | V | )
